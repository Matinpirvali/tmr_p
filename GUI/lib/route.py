# To change the system DNS settings using Python, you can use the pyroute2 library, which
# provides a Pythonic interface for network configuration. Here's an example of how you can change the DNS settings:

# First, make sure you have the pyroute2 library installed. You can install it using pip:
# pip install pyroute2

# Then, you can use the following code to change the system DNS settings:
from pyroute2 import IPRoute

def change_dns_servers(interface, dns_servers):
    ip = IPRoute()
    index = ip.link_lookup(ifname=interface)[0]
    
    # Get the current configuration
    attrs = ip.get_addr(index=index)[0]['attrs']
    
    # Find the DNS section in the configuration
    dns_attrs = [attr for attr in attrs if attr[0] == 'IFA_LOCAL']
    
    if dns_attrs:
        # Set the new DNS servers
        dns_attrs[0][1] = dns_servers.encode()
        ip.flush_addr(index=index)
        ip.addr('add', index=index, address='0.0.0.0', mask=0, broadcast='0.0.0.0', attrs=attrs)
        print("DNS servers changed successfully.")
    else:
        print("DNS configuration not found.")
    ip.close()

# Usage example
interface_name = 'eth0'  # Replace with your interface name
new_dns_servers = '8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4'  # Replace with the desired DNS servers

change_dns_servers(interface_name, new_dns_servers)
